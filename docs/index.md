## Introduction

LiteX refers primarily to the process of defining and building hardware designs, including IP components and entire System-on-Chips (SoCs), using the Migen Python internal Domain Specific Language (DSL).

The LiteX library contains a collection of soft RISC-V processor cores and IP components, such as DRAM controllers, Ethernet cores, PCIe, SATA, HDMI, and more, which are described using this Migen/Python approach. In this project we are targetting adding an Interrupt Controller.
