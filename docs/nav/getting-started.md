# Getting Started

## Introduction

By integrating RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) support into the LiteX SoC framework, we aim to enhance LiteX with modern interrupt handling capabilities that support message-signaled interrupts (MSIs), virtualization, and improved scalability for multi-core systems.

### Background
The RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) represents the next generation of interrupt handling for RISC-V systems, offering significant advantages over traditional interrupt controllers:

Message-Signaled Interrupts (MSIs): Direct support for PCIe and other modern peripheral standards
Virtualization Support: Hardware-assisted interrupt virtualization for guest VMs
Scalability: Support for up to 16,384 harts with thousands of interrupt sources
Flexible Priority Management: Software-configurable interrupt priorities across all interrupt types
Improved Latency: Hardware acceleration for interrupt delivery and handling
